usage:

./debuncher <filename> <traping time [ms]> <extraction time [ms]>

The code estimates the number of ions registrated by the MCP

The efficientcy test:
The ions are injected in the debuncher trapped for the certain time and then ejected in a short time registrated by MCP and the FASTER acquisition. The code will estimate the number ions per bunch and the average number of ions perbunch

The debunching:
In this case for the trapping time, we should put injection time ~10us and for the extraction time we should put the real trapping time as in this case the ions are extracted during the trapping
